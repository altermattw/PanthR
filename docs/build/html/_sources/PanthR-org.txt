==============

This web site will serve multiple purposes:

1. A central location from which institutions or individuals interested in hosting a :doc:`Server` can download it.
2. When a Tablet App becomes available, it should probably be accessible from here as well.
3. Instructions, tutorials on using the PanthR webapp
4. Information on each available server, including their current and maximum load, current latency, status of public vs private etc.
5. A Web Service that clients can use to store preferences. This service will provide a :doc:`Server` with `OAuth <www.oauth.net/>`_ access to the user's data and preferences.
6. The Javascript for the client, especially the statistics libraries, should probably be accessible from here if possible, so as not to require re-downloading when a client switches servers (would need to bypass same source issues).
