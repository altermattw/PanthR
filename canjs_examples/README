Examples of using can.js. Need to be removed at some point in the future.

To see the examples in action, open the html files in them on a browser. For instance on my
computer, the resulting link looks like this:

file:///Users/haris/Sites/PanthR/canjs_examples/example1/todo.html

Double-clicking the file or dragging it onto the browser icon or a browser window might do the
trick.
